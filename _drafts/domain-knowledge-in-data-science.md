This is a continuation of the previous blog post [What is random in data?](/2015-07-01/what-is-random-data). Basically, the goal is to tie domain knowledge, qualitative modeling, the Central Limit Theorem and linear regression.

In the final days of my Data Science class, I provide a discussion of "where to go from here". It lists quite a few options, depending on the tastes and whims of the student. I always encourage more statistics and, since the class is taught using Python, to learn R.

Perhaps the two most important pieces of advice I give are to have patience with oneself and to exercise humility.

1. data science is everyday problem solved with algorithms and computers.
2. the most important part of data science is communication, identifying the problem and communicating the solution.
3. science--biology, chemistry, sociology--relies on a body of existing knowledge that usually comes under the rubric of theory and concepts.
4. data science focuses more on problem solving but has no less a need for theory which generally falls under the rubric of "domain knowledge".
5. Because this domain knowledge is usually informal and fragmented across an organization, it's prudent to systematize that domain knowledge (or parts of it) in the context of a specific problem before trying to solve that problem.
6. One way we might solve that problem is by using Systems Theory or more specifically Causal Loop Diagrams from Systems Dynamics.
