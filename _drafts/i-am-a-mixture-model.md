One of the more difficult things to understand is that although you get approximately 50% of your DNA from your father and 50% of your DNA from your mother, in terms of the *sources* of that DNA, it doesn't work out exactly the same.

Let's assume for the moment that you're a simple creature with a single chromosome with two halves (diploid). You live in an isolated area. You have the chromosome `DD` and your mate also has `DD`. This means your child has `DD` because `DD + DD => DD`. A river is bridged and your child falls in love with a member of a neighboring tribe, `F`. They have children who are `DF` because `DD + FF => DF`.

A similar pattern has been happening in another part of the world, where `B` and `A` meet and have children: `BB + AA => BA`. Your child and this other child meet and have four children, your grandchildren: `DF + BA => DB, DA, FB, FA`. Remember that you are `DD`. What can we conclude?

1. Although all 4 children have the same parents, some of the children share *no* DNA. `DB` shares no DNA with `FA`.
2. Similarly, although you are the grandparent, two of the children have *none* of your DNA, `FB` and `FA`, although they have your mate's DNA, `FF`.

Now humans have 22 basic chromosomes (plus the sex chromosome which we'll skip for now). This same process happens for each *individual* chromosome. With a bit of simplification, if we look above at the possible permutations of grandchildren, this becomes the possible permutations of chromosomes. Your grandchild might end up with `DB, DA, FB, FA, FB,..., DB.`. A different grandchild will end up with a different mix, `FA, FB, DA, DB, FB,...,DA`. The first one might have more `D` from you and another might have more `F` from your mate. While it is true that the child inherits 50% of the DNA from one of its parents (your child), it's not necessarily true that it will inherit 25% of your DNA. In fact, the further away the ancestor is from the child, the more likely that this percentage includes 0%.

Now, it gets a bit more complicated again because in the testing doesn't look at the whole chromosome `FA` or even each half, `F` or `A` but at markers on each chromosome. These genetic markers (DNA markers) are tied to reference populations and this is how they determine if you are part "French" or "Irish". Basically, you have DNA markers that are associated with either the French or Irish reference populations.

If you consider all the markers, when the testing service says that your father is 25% Irish, they mean, 25% of his DNA markers match those of the Irish reference population. For now on, we'll take the shortcut and say "25% Irish" instead of 25% Irish DNA markers.

This means that while your father might himself be 25% Irish (as measured by the DNA markers), you can inherit anywhere from 0 to 100% of them. In which case, you will end up being 0% to 25% Irish. Note that you do not, of necessity, end up being 50% x 25% or 12.5% Irish. You only inherit 50% of your father's total DNA...there's nothing that says what 50% you have to inherit.

Now suppose your father is 73% Irish, you will be, at a minimum, 23% Irish to a maximum of 50% Irish. The minimum comes because you must inherit 50% of his DNA (in which case you have 23% Irish and 27% "Other"). The maximum comes because you can only inherit 50% of his DNA in which case you get (50% Irish and 50% "Other").

The real fun comes if your mother is also part Irish. Suppose your mother has is 34% Irish. Using the logic above, you can get anywhere from 0% to 100% of the DNA markers. So at one extreme, you could get 25% "Irish" from your father and 34% "Irish"from your mother with 41% other and thus be more "Irish" than either your father or your mother but still get 50% of your DNA from your father and 50% of your DNA from your mother. Crazy.
